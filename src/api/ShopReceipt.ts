Each time you successfully submit tracking info, Etsy sends a notification email to the buyer User. When send_bcc is true, Etsy sends shipping notifications to the seller as well.

If the carrier is not supported, you may use `other` as the carrier name so you can provide the tracking code. **NOTE** When shipping within the United States AND the order is over $10 _or_ when shipping to India, tracking code and carrier name ARE required.
